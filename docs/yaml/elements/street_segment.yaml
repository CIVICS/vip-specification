    example is "NE" for the address "100 E Capitol St NE."

  required: true
  type: xs:string
- _name: IncludesAllAddresses
  description: Specifies if the segment covers every address on this street. If this
    is *true*, then the values of **StartHouseNumber** and **EndHouseNumber** should
    be ignored. The value of **OddEvenBoth** must be *both*.
  error_then: =must-ignore
  type: xs:boolean
- _name: OddEvenBoth
  description: Specifies whether the odd side of the street (in terms of house numbers),
    the even side, or both are in included in the street segment.
  error: If the field is not present or invalid, the implementation is required to
    ignore the StreetSegment containing it.
  required: true
  type: OebEnum
- _name: PrecinctId
  description: References the :doc:`precinct <precinct>` that contains the entire
    street segment.
  error: If the field is not present or invalid, the implementation is required to
    ignore the StreetSegment element containing it.
  type: xs:IDREF
- _name: StartHouseNumber
  description: The house number at which the street segment starts. This value is
    necessary for the street segment to make any sense. Unless **IncludesAllAddresses**
    is true, this value must be less than or equal to **EndHouseNumber**. If **IncludesAllAddresses**
    is true, this value is ignored.
  error: Unless **IncludesAllAddresses** is true, if the field is not present or invalid,
    the implementation is required to ignore the StreetSegment element containing
    it. If the **StartHouseNumber** is greater than the **EndHouseNumber**, the implementation
    should ignore the element containing them.
  type: xs:integer
- _name: EndHouseNumber
  description: The house number at which the street segment ends. This value is necessary
    for the street segment to make any sense. Unless **IncludesAllAddresses** is true,
    it must be greater than or equal to **StartHouseNumber**. If **IncludesAllAddresses**
    is true, this value is ignored.
  error: Unless **IncludesAllAddresses** is true, if the field is not present or invalid,
    the implementation is required to ignore the StreetSegment element containing
    it. If the **EndHouseNumber** is less than the **StartHouseNumber**, the implementation
    should ignore the element containing it.

  error_then: =must-ignore
  type: xs:string
- _name: StreetName
  description: Represents the name of the street for the address. A special wildcard,
    "*", denotes every street in the given city/town. It optionally may contain street
    direction, street suffix or address direction (e.g., both "Capitol" and "E Capitol
    St NE" are acceptable for the address "100 E Capitol St NE"), however this is
    not preferred. Preferred is street name alone (e.g. "Capitol").
  error_then: =must-ignore
