Welcome to the Voting Information Project Specification documentation
=====================================================================
Welcome to the `Voting Information Project's`_ (VIP) open XML and flat file (CSV) format. This data
format provides an easy way to produce data that lets developers take a voter's address, compare it
to street segments, and determine that voter's precinct (or precinct split). Knowing a voter's
precinct allows information disseminators (such as `Google`_) to provide voters with their official
polling locations (and early voting sites), ballots (including both candidates and referenda), local
election administrations, and election officials.
