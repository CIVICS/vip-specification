  The ``ExternalIdentifiers`` element allows VIP data to connect with external datasets (e.g.
  candidates with campaign finance datasets, electoral geographies with `OCD-IDs`_ that allow for
  greater connectivity with additional datasets, etc...). Examples for ``ExternalIdentifiers`` can be
  found on the objects that support them:

  * :ref:`$$$-candidate`

  * Any element that extends :ref:`$$$-contest-base`

  * :ref:`$$$-electoral-district`

  * :ref:`$$$-locality`

  * :ref:`$$$-office`

  * :ref:`$$$-party`

  * :ref:`$$$-precinct`

  * :ref:`$$$-state`
