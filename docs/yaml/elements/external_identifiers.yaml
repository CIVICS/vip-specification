  The ``ExternalIdentifiers`` element allows VIP data to connect with external datasets (e.g.
  candidates with campaign finance datasets, electoral geographies with `OCD-IDs`_ that allow for
  greater connectivity with additional datasets, etc...). Examples for ``ExternalIdentifiers`` can be
  found on the objects that support them:

  * :ref:`single-xml-candidate`

  * Any element that extends :ref:`single-xml-contest-base`

  * :ref:`single-xml-electoral-district`

  * :ref:`single-xml-locality`

  * :ref:`single-xml-office`

  * :ref:`single-xml-party`

  * :ref:`single-xml-precinct`

  * :ref:`single-xml-state`
