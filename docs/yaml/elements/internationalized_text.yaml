  ``InternationalizedText`` allows for support of multiple languages for a string.
  ``InternationalizedText`` has an optional attribute ``label``, which allows the feed to refer
  back to the original label for the information (e.g. if the contact information came from a
  CSV, ``label`` may refer to a row ID). Examples of ``InternationalizedText`` can be seen in:

  * Any element that extends :ref:`single-xml-contest-base`

  * Any element that extends :ref:`single-xml-ballot-selection-base`

  * :doc:`Candidate <candidate>`

  * :doc:`ContactInformation <contact_information>`

  * :doc:`Election <election>`

  * :doc:`ElectionAdministration <election_administration>`

  * :doc:`Office <office>`

  * :ref:`single-xml-party`

  * :doc:`Person <person>`

  * :doc:`PollingLocation <polling_location>`

  * :doc:`Source <source>`
