  ``InternationalizedText`` allows for support of multiple languages for a string.
  ``InternationalizedText`` has an optional attribute ``label``, which allows the feed to refer
  back to the original label for the information (e.g. if the contact information came from a
  CSV, ``label`` may refer to a row ID). Examples of ``InternationalizedText`` can be seen in:

  * Any element that extends :ref:`$$$-contest-base`

  * Any element that extends :ref:`$$$-ballot-selection-base`

  * :ref:`$$$-candidate`

  * :ref:`$$$-contact-information`

  * :ref:`$$$-election`

  * :ref:`$$$-election-administration`

  * :ref:`$$$-office`

  * :ref:`$$$-party`

  * :ref:`$$$-person`

  * :ref:`$$$-polling-location`

  * :ref:`$$$-source`
