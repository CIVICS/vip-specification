PartyContest
============

An extension of :ref:`single-xml-contest-base` which describes a contest in
which the possible ballot selections are of type :doc:`PartySelection
<party_selection>`. These could include contests in which straight-party
selections are allowed, or party-list contests (although these are more common
outside of the United States).
