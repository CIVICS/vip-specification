  ``OrderedContest`` encapsulates links to the information that comprises a contest and potential
  ballot selections. ``OrderedContest`` elements can be collected within a
  :doc:`BallotStyle <ballot_style>` to accurate depict exactly what will show up on a particular
  ballot in the proper order.
