open XML and flat file (CSV) format. This data format provides an easy way to produce
data that lets programmers take a voter's address, compare it to street segments, and
determine that voter's precinct (or precinct split). Knowing a voter's precinct allows
information disseminators (such as Google) to provide voters with their official polling
locations (and early voting sites), ballots (including both candidates and referenda),
local election administrations, and election officials.
